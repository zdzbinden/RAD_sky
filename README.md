# RAD_sky

The file converters were written by Steve Mussmann https://github.com/smussmann82. 

This script takes the output from pyrad and creates a properly formatted NEXUS file
filtered to contain only loci that contain a specified number of SNPs. 

The goal is to be able to use ddRAD data in coalescent based analyses.
